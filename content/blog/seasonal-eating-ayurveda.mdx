# Seasonal Eating in Ayurveda

Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of eating according to the seasons (Ritucharya) to maintain optimal health and prevent disease.

## Spring (Vasant Ritu)
- Light, easily digestible foods
- Bitter, astringent, and pungent tastes
- Fresh greens and sprouts
- Avoid heavy, sweet foods

## Summer (Grishma Ritu)
- Cooling, hydrating foods
- Sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes
- Fresh fruits and vegetables
- Light meals at regular intervals

## Monsoon (Varsha Ritu)
- Freshly cooked, warm foods
- Avoid raw foods
- Include ginger, turmeric
- Light soups and broths

## Autumn (Sharad Ritu)
- Balance of light and nourishing foods
- Sweet, bitter, and astringent tastes
- Seasonal fruits and vegetables
- Avoid excessive heat-producing foods

## Winter (Hemant Ritu)
- Warm, nourishing foods
- Sweet, sour, and salty tastes
- Healthy fats and proteins
- Root vegetables and whole grains

Remember to adjust these guidelines based on your personal constitution (Prakriti) and current state of health (Vikriti).
