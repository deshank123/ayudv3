# Understanding Your Dosha Type

Ayurveda recognizes three fundamental energies or doshas that govern our physical and mental processes: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.

## Vata Dosha
Vata is composed of Air and Space elements. People with predominant Vata energy typically:
- Are creative and quick-thinking
- Have a light, thin build
- May experience dry skin and cold hands
- Are energetic and flexible
- Can be prone to anxiety when imbalanced

## Pitta Dosha
Pitta represents Fire and Water elements. Pitta-dominant individuals often:
- Have a medium, athletic build
- Display strong digestion and metabolism
- Are intelligent and sharp-minded
- Show natural leadership qualities
- May experience inflammation when imbalanced

## Kapha Dosha
Kapha combines Earth and Water elements. Those with strong Kapha typically:
- Have a solid, well-developed build
- Show excellent stamina and strength
- Are calm and grounded
- Have good immunity
- May gain weight easily when imbalanced

Understanding your dominant dosha helps you make better choices in diet, exercise, and lifestyle to maintain optimal health.
